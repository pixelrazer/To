                            I can't believe it's already been two months since we found each other on that app. So much has happened since then and yet, every moment with you still feels new and magical.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When I think of you, I feel warmth in my chest and peace in my soul. You've shown me what it truly means to love and be loved in return. Your laugh is my favorite sound. Your happiness is my greatest joy. In a world full of temporary things, you are my constant.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I remember the first time we met in person I was so scared and nervous. If I‚Äôm being honest, I was afraid you wouldn‚Äôt like me in real life. But you proved me wrong in the most beautiful way. You showed me how much you enjoyed being with me, and I‚Äôll never forget that.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When I saw you for the first time, I couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes. You were even more gorgeous than I imagined so much so that, for a second, I thought you weren‚Äôt real. My heart skipped a beat. My hands got sweaty the closer you walked toward me. I was speechless, shy, overwhelmed by how amazing you looked. 
                        <p>
                            The more we spent time together, the more I realized how much I loved being around you. God, hearing your laugh, seeing your smile it just warms my heart and makes my day every time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of my favorite memories with you was when we took that peaceful walk on the marina walkway, right by our hotel. There were no distractions just us, the ocean breeze, and those cute little ground squirrels you were obsessed with. I still remember how big your smile was seeing them. We laughed, gave them silly names, and just talked. It was simple, but perfect. I didn‚Äôt want that moment to end.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And then came the last day. I didn‚Äôt want you to leave. It hurt so much knowing I had to take you back. Honestly, part of me thought about just not taking you because I didn‚Äôt want to let you go. I wanted you to stay with me forever.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You've got me completely obsessed with you. I love you harder than I‚Äôve ever loved anyone in my life. I want you and only you, mi amor. I‚Äôm not here to play games. I‚Äôm not looking for anyone else, and I‚Äôm not here just for the moment. I‚Äôm here for the long run with the girl of my dreams.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I know it might sound soon, but I truly hope we get married one day. I date to marry, not to mess around. You‚Äôre the one I want to build a life with.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I‚Äôll always support you and stand by your side. That night we made promises to each other intimate, vulnerable, meaningful promises and I meant every single one.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thank you for being with me. I know I‚Äôm not always easy to understand. I overthink a lot, even over the smallest things. But thank you for staying. Thank you for coming to see me. Thank you for everything you do for us.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I love you so much, mi amor. I‚Äôll never give up on us, or on you. I‚Äôll work hard for us, and I‚Äôll give you the life you were meant to have.
                        </p>
